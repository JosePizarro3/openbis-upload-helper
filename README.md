# OpenBIS Upload Helper

The openBIS Upload Helper is a tool to parse files and extract their relevant metadata into objects and vocabularies in openBIS.

This tool works using the package [`bam-masterdata`](https://github.com/BAMresearch/bam-masterdata) to grep the object types definitions. Each parser is loaded via entry points from individual GitHub repositories (see e.g., [`masterdata-parser-example`](https://github.dev/BAMresearch/masterdata-parser-example)).


## Usage

If you want to use this tool for your own openBIS instance, we recommend:
1. Fork the `bam-masterdata` repository.
2. Fork this `openbis-upload-helper` repository.
3. Adapt both forks to your specific openBIS instance.
4. Create your own GitHub repositories for your parsers.
5. Deploy the app at your convenience.

## Development

If you want to develop locally this package, clone the project and enter in the workspace folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BAMresearch/openbis-upload-helper.git
cd openbis-upload-helper
```

Create a virtual environment (you can use Python>3.10) in your workspace:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the following commands to pip install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install uv
uv pip install -e '.[dev,parsers]'
```

**Note**: The parsers are loaded as entry points via the optional dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` of this repository. More info under Parsers and Dynamic Plugins.


### Configuration: settings.ini

A sample settings file is provided at:
`openbis_upload_helper\uploader\settings.ini.example`

Copy this file to the project root and rename it to **`settings.ini`**. **Do not commit or push this file** to the repository because it contains secrets.

What to set inside
- **DEBUG**: set to `True` for local **development** so the Django development server will serve static files automatically.
- **SECRET_KEY**: Django secret key for cryptographic signing.
- **SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY**: application-specific encryption key used by this project.
- **CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS**: include your local host entries (for example `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Use full scheme + host entries.
- **OPENBIS_URL**: openBIS instance URL for uploading the data.
- **SPACE_FILTER**: List of space codes to exclude from display (e.g. ["DEFAULT", "SETTINGS"])
- **UPLOAD_SIZE_LIMIT**: Maximum total size of the uploaded files in bytes. Example: `UPLOAD_SIZE_LIMIT=10000000000` for 10 GiB. The value must be an integer (bytes).
- **UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS**: Maximum time allowed for the file upload and extraction phase (in seconds). If the loader spends longer than this value while receiving/writing/extracting files, the upload will be aborted. Example: `UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=3000`.


Static files note
- With **DEBUG=True**, the development server serves static files automatically.
- With **DEBUG=False** you must collect static files and serve them with a proper web server.

Database and admin steps
- Run migrations before starting the server:
`python openbis_upload_helper\manage.py migrate`

- If you need the Django admin site, create a superuser after migrating:
`python openbis_upload_helper\manage.py createsuperuser`

Order recommendation (development)
1. Copy and configure **`settings.ini`** or **`.env`**.
2. `python openbis_upload_helper\manage.py migrate`
3. (Optional) `python openbis_upload_helper\manage.py createsuperuser`

### Run the app

You can locally deploy the app for development by running:
```sh
python openbis_upload_helper/manage.py runserver
```

This will run the Django app server:
```sh

```

Simply click on the localhost address, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, to launch the app locally.

# Parsers and Dynamic Plugins

This project discovers parser plugins at runtime using Python entry points.

## How it works

1. **Include the parser dependency**

   Add the parser to your `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]` in the `parsers` section.

2. **Install the parser**

   After adding the dependency, install it with:

   ```sh
   uv pip install -e .[parsers]
    ```
3. **Load the parser at runtime**

    The application uses the loader function [get_entry_point_parsers]
    It scans the configured entry point group and returns the available parser plugins dynamically.


## Tauri dev

Make sure you have installed the prerequisites for your OS: https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/, then run:

```bash
cd openbis-upload-helper
pnpm install
pnpm tauri android init
```

For Desktop development, run:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

For Android development, run:

```bash
pnpm tauri android dev
```

For Python sidecar:

```bash
uv run pyinstaller \
  --name openbis-helper-python \
  src/openbis_upload_helper/main.py
```

### Build order

The build order is:

1. Build the Python sidecar with PyInstaller:

```bash
uv run pyinstaller \
  --onefile \
  --name openbis-helper-python \
  src/openbis_upload_helper/main.py
```

2. Copy or rename the resulting executable into the path/name Tauri expects, for example:

```
src-tauri/binaries/openbis-helper-python-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

3. Then build Tauri:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```
